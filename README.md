📑 Legal Contract Summarizer & Risk Detector
📝 Project Overview
This project builds a Legal Contract Summarizer and Clause Risk Detector using deep learning and NLP techniques. It reads legal documents, highlights important clauses, classifies them by type, and optionally summarizes them. The goal is to assist legal teams, startups, and professionals in quickly understanding critical aspects of contracts and potential risks.

📌 Features
📄 Legal document ingestion (PDF, DOCX, or plain text)

🏷️ Clause classification into categories (e.g. Indemnity, Confidentiality, Governing Law)

⚠️ Risk and critical clause flagging

📝 Clause-level summarization

📊 Explainable AI (with attention visualization / SHAP)

🌐 Deployable web interface (Gradio / Streamlit)

📚 Data Sources
Dataset	Description	Link
CUAD v1	13,000+ labeled contract clauses across 41 categories	GitHub
SEC EDGAR Filings	Public filings for additional contract examples	SEC
CaseLaw Access Project	Publicly available U.S. case law (optional extension)	Case.law

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language Models: Legal-BERT, DeBERTa, or RoBERTa (Hugging Face Transformers)

Summarization Models: Pegasus, T5

Data Processing: Pandas, NLTK, SpaCy

Deployment: Streamlit / Gradio / Hugging Face Spaces

Explainability: LIME / SHAP / Attention Visualizations

Cloud: Google Colab / Render / Heroku

📈 Project Roadmap
📂 1️⃣ Data Preparation
Download CUAD dataset.

Preprocess legal documents: remove headers, footers, signatures.

Split clauses into individual samples.

🤖 2️⃣ Model Training
Clause Classification:

Fine-tune Legal-BERT or DeBERTa on CUAD categories.

Clause Summarization:

Fine-tune T5/Pegasus on CUAD summaries or use zero-shot summarization.

🔍 3️⃣ Risk & Critical Clause Detection
Define risk categories (e.g. indemnity, termination, liability caps).

Classify clauses and flag high-risk categories.

Optionally set thresholds based on attention weights.

🌐 4️⃣ Frontend Deployment
Build a Streamlit/Gradio web interface.

Upload contract → Extract clauses → Run classification/summarization → Display results.

📊 5️⃣ Explainability (Bonus)
Integrate LIME/SHAP or attention visualizations for clause classification decisions.
